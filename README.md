# habits_academic_performance
## Project Summary

This project investigates whether academic performance can be predicted from self-reported student lifestyle habits. Using a dataset of 1,000 synthetic student profiles, nine regression models were evaluated and compared.

### Models Implemented
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Polynomial Regression (degree 2)
- SVR (Linear, RBF, Polynomial Kernels)
- Random Forest Regressor
- K-Nearest Neighbors

### Key Findings
- **Lasso Regression** performed best with a Test RMSE of 5.13.
- Study hours, screen time, sleep, and mental health were top predictors.
- PCA showed that 14 principal components could explain over 90% of the dataset's variance.
- Residual analysis and error quartiles revealed stable model performance across most cases.

## Figures Included
- Numeric & categorical distributions
- Correlation heatmap
- RMSE comparison bar chart
- Residual plot and absolute error spread
- Feature importance bar chart
- PCA explained variance curve
- Preprocessing pipeline flowchart
